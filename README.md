# AV2 - Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to **congenital syphilis cases**, using **Python** for data preparation, visualization, and insights extraction.

## Contents

- **Data Files**:
  - `data_types.csv`: Contains metadata about the data types in the dataset.
  - `missing_data_df.csv`: Highlights missing values within the dataset.
  - `not_informed_values.csv`: Summary of values that were not informed in specific fields.
  
- **Code and Analysis**:
  - `model_training_ml.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the training of machine learning models.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - `boxplots/`: Folder containing boxplot visualizations for various features.
  - `histograms/`: Folder containing histograms for the distribution of key dataset variables.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is stored in CSV format and is focused on **congenital syphilis cases**, with information about data types and missing values already analyzed. All preprocessing and analysis steps have been documented in the notebook.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identified and handled missing data (`missing_data_df.csv`).
   - Categorized data types (`data_types.csv`).

2. **Visualization**:
   - Boxplots and histograms to identify trends and outliers.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Basic machine learning models for predicting outcomes based on the dataset.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the analysis:

1. Install Python (>=3.8).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
